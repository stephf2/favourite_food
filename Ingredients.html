        <h2>Pizza</h2>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <p>
            For the base <br>
            <ul>
                <li>300g strong bread flour </li>
                <li> 1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt </li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
            </ul>
            
            For the tomato sauce <br>
            <ul>
                <li>100ml passata </li>
                <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried </li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
             </ul>
             
            For the topping <br>
            <ul>
                <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced </li>
                <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
                <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            </ul>
            
            To finish <br>
            <ul>
                <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Method</h5>
            STEP 1
            To make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly. <br><br>

            STEP 2
            Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife. <br><br>

            STEP 3
            Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight. <br><br>

            STEP 4
            Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top. <br><br>

        <h2>Macaroni cheese</h2>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>50g baguette, cut into small chunks</li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter, plus 1 tbsp melted </li>
                <li>350g spiral or other short pasta</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
                <li> 1 tsp English mustard powder</li>
                <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
                <li>500ml whole milk</li>
                <li>250g vegetarian mature cheddar, grated</li>
                <li>50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Method</h5>
            STEP 1
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust. <br><br>

            STEP 2
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base. <br><br>

            STEP 3
            Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets. <br><br>

            STEP 4
            Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza. <br><br>
